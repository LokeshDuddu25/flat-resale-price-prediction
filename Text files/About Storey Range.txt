The Storey Range indicates the floor level on which a flat is located — for example, “01–03”, “07–09”, or “13–15”.

Higher storey ranges often mean better views, more privacy, and less noise, leading to slightly higher resale prices.

🧩 Meaning

Each storey range represents a group of floors, not a single floor.
For instance:

“01–03” → Ground to 3rd floor

“07–09” → 7th to 9th floor

“13–15” → 13th to 15th floor
